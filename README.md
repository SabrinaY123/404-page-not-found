<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](/images/404-not-found-screenshot.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?

  The link to my demo is located at the top of this file under "demo".

- What was your experience?

  I had fun with this project! I just started learning HTML and CSS but this project was fairly straightforward.

- What have you learned/improved?

  I have improved in my abilities with grid system! And specifically learned and took my time with understanding how the display flex property works. I also finally started using media query breakpoints to assist my website in becoming more responsive.

- Your wisdom? :)

  Still increasing everyday but I am curious to learning much more. Any feedback is appreciated!
